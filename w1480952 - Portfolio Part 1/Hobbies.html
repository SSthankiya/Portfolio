  <p>I have participated in lots of activities out of school too. I got a Jack Patchy award for cricket, colt’s day tournament I was awarded for the winning team at Old Parkonians Cricket Club. Since the age of five I had been playing cricket with my family. I have improved my skills in cricket so that I can get better at the sport that I enjoy and have interest in. I finish swimming course along with completing the survival challenge in swimming. I have plenty of certificate to show that I have been getting better in swimming from the age of 5 to the age of 16 also I have taken part in a sponsored swim for Helen Rollason cancer care and APPLE and I have a certificate to show that I have taken part in this event and it has been signed by councilor Charles Elliman the mayor of Redbridge, also during this sponsored swim I had raised £250 for Helen Rollason cancer care and APPLE (association of prostate patients in London & Essex). Therefore by doing so many activities, I have achieved so many awards in clubs that I played for which shows that I am very enthusiastic and able person.</p>
