    <h3>First Semestar</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Computer System Fundamentals</li>
    <p>This module is centred on the fundamental aspects of the way that a typical computer functions either as a standalone entity or as part of a computer network. Discussion of the main hardware components of a computer system provides the backdrop to introduce the Von Neumann fetch–decode–execute cycle as well as the way in which data and information are stored in the computer. Progressing from the hardware level, students learn about the lowest programming level that humans can understand in the form of assembly programming.</p>
    <li>Mathematics for Computing</li>
    <p>This module introduces elements of discrete and analytical mathematics for computing students. Topics include numeric systems, sets, relations, functions, introduction to logic and proof, Boolean algebra, matrices and vectors.</p>
    <li>Software Development Principles 1</li>
    <p>An introduction to Computer Programming with a strongly-typed language. The module concentrates on teaching the fundamentals of programming by considering numerous algorithms and code examples involving sequence, selection, and iteration.  Various solutions will be designed and implemented to provide practical experience and feedback. The use of windows objects and event handling will also be covered.</p>
  </ul>
    <h3>Second Semestar</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Communication and Careers Managements</li>
    <p>Within this module, it will be enable Computer Science students to build their confident in presenting to crowd of people and writing reports skills. It provides students with a theoretical overview of the discipline and supports them in communicating their learning effectively by choosing appropriate writing and/or speaking styles. The skills they acquire will support them in their studies, future career, as well as in securing a placement. </p>
    <li>Information Systems</li>
    <p>This module will cover the role of information within an organisation, the differences between information requirements and processing requirements, and the relationship between processing and data. Students will learn how to construct simple entity-relationship models, how to represent these models as tables in a relational database system, and how to access the data in the tables using SQL.</p>
    <li>Software Development Principle 2</li>
    <p>This module aims to develop understanding and confidence in the use of common algorithms and programming constructs to design code and test small scale programs using intermediate level programming techniques.</p>
    <li>Web Technology</li>
    <p>This module provides a practical introduction to Internet programming in a variety of commonly used languages. The interaction of the different scripts with the Website will be introduced, together with other relevant aspects of the different languages used. Students will gain practical experience of appropriate program development and Web page design tools, and will be expected to write programs and Web pages conforming to given stylistic guidelines. The module will also introduce students to legislation relevant to web page content.</p>
  </ul>

<div id="tabs-4">
    <h3>First Semestar</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Computer Science and Software Engineering Project Part 1</li>
    <p>This module requires students to produce an extended piece of work covering a variety of activities related to a single theme. The theme chosen must be appropriate within the Computer Science discipline. This will require the student to combine previously acquired knowledge and techniques with newly researched ideas, the results to be communicated in a report and viva. Students will work independently under the guidance of a supervisor and will be expected to develop the work systematically.</p>
    <li>Security and Forensics</li>
    <p>This module examines various aspects of computer security and forensics, including legal, ethical and professional issues, giving a sound introduction to theoretical and practical areas. A substantial amount of work will be laboratory based involving the deployment of security tools, the hardening of operating systems and the analysis of compromised systems.</p>
